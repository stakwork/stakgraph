# Data Structures Test Server

This subdirectory tests parsing of common C data structures:

- **Hash Table**: Structs with pointer indirection, complex loops, string handling (`strdup`, `strcmp`).
- **Binary Search Tree**: Recursive data structures and functions.
- **Generic pointers**: `void*` usage in structs.
